            <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>I'm an energetic graphic designer, web designer, animator, and photographer that oozes fun and creativity! What makes me even more unique is that my background in retail management and sales has not only given me the ability to manage teams with ease, but to have a very goal-oriented, timeline driven, go get 'em mindset that is hard to find with most creatives. My goal when working with clients is to create pieces that are exhilarating and unique while still being functional. In my spare time, I enjoy volunteering my services to support non-profits such as Lynn Meadows and the American Cancer Society, as well as for the local athletic associations like Icy Pint Athletics, Tri Hard Sports, and Aloha Paddle.</p>
